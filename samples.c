/* This is just a commented file that contains important equations to be aware while coding the program:
 * Also some features of the program are explained here.
 * 3 * 5 -> Spaces are ignored 
 * 5 - 6 / 2 -> This has to return 2, (not -1/2) because of the math calculation arragement 
 * 4 + (5 - 2 * 3) * 3 -> This has to return 1 because parantheses are calculated first 
 * (3 - 2) * (4 * 2) This is important due to my parsing algorithm 
 * 3 * 4 - 2 / 2 -> This is important due to my parsing algorithm
